# How to contribute

Third-party patches are essential for keeping Puppet open-source projects
great. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
allow you to get the most out of our projects. There are a few guidelines
that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.  For more info, see our canonical guide to contributing:
